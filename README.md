# Welcome to Buffalo!

Thank you for choosing Buffalo for your web development needs.

## Database Setup

It looks like you chose to set up your application using a database! Fantastic!

The first thing you need to do is open up the "database.yml" file and edit it to use the correct usernames, passwords, hosts, etc... that are appropriate for your environment.

You will also need to make sure that **you** start/install the database of your choice. Buffalo **won't** install and start it for you.

### Create Your Databases

Ok, so you've edited the "database.yml" file and started your database, now Buffalo can create the databases in that file for you:

	$ buffalo pop create -a

## Starting the Application

Buffalo ships with a command that will watch your application and automatically rebuild the Go binary and any assets for you. To do that run the "buffalo dev" command:

	$ buffalo dev

If you point your browser to [http://127.0.0.1:3000](http://127.0.0.1:3000) you should see a "Welcome to Buffalo!" page.

**Congratulations!** You now have your Buffalo application up and running.

## What Next?

We recommend you heading over to [http://gobuffalo.io](http://gobuffalo.io) and reviewing all of the great documentation there.

Good luck!

### Start database in docker container during development

	docker run -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres -p 5433:5432 postgres

	buffalo pop create

	buffalo pop migrate

### Log into docker container and check tables

### WHERE I LEFT OFF
Was in the middle of switching up how we do authentication. I'm going to do my own jwt stuff instead of using the package.

I now need to switch the sign in page to do stuff through react so I can accept the token back from my api request and set it in the local storage.

Then I can send this jwt on all subsequenct requests.
